#+TITLE: M-x dired-open-with

Right-clicking a file in most GUI file managers provides an
"Open with" menu for choosing which application should used. This package
implements such functionality for Emacs default file manager Dired.

There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU1E0M8FAX4][video about helm-dired-open]]. You can use this package
exactly the same, only the command is now ~M-x dired-open-with~.

** Installation

The package is not available on MELPA yet, please use Quelpa (or your
preferred package manager) to install.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package dired-open-with
  :quelpa (dired-open-with
           :fetcher github
           :repo "FrostyX/dired-open-with"
           :branch "main"))
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

The ~M-x dired-open-with~ command works out of the box without any
additional configuration. If you want to change candidates for a
given file type, change your XDG settings.

** Alternatives

If you don't need an "Open with" dialog but rather open files in
their default appliaction, you can use ~M-x dired-open~ or
~M-x dired-open-xdg~ from the [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks#dired-open][dired-hacks]] package.

There is also [[https://github.com/FrostyX/helm-dired-open][helm-dired-open]], which as the name suggests is limited
to [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]]. However, it provides some configuration options that this
packages doesn't have.
