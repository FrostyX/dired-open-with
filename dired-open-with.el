;;
;; An 'Open with' dialog for opening files in external applications from Dired.
;;
;; This package is built upon freedesktop.org features and therefore works
;; only on operating systems and desktop environments that comply with the
;; XDG specifications. That should be true for the majority of GNU/Linux
;; distributions and BSD variants. I don't know what is the situation on
;; MS Windows, macOS, or and mobile systems.
